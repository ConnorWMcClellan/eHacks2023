~comm.py~
This file interacts with AWS Rekognition. It takes the name that was matched and
	records a new "punch" in the database. The database is powered by Mongo.
	Python is not a strong language for me, and I have never worked with Mongo.
	This provided for a new challenge to learn information, download necessary
	tools, and implement features in a limited amount of time.

~comm.js~
This file pulls the "punches" from the database and outputs it to the terminal. It
	is intended to send the data to HTML so that the interface is visually
	pleasing; however, we hit a last-minute road bump where sending such data
	became a challenge for the given time remaining. JavaScript is a language I
	have used before, but trying to send Node.js specific code to HTML presented
	new obstacles. Given more time, these issues would be futher researched and
	resolved.
